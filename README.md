## About
**RestAPI** that can send and receive Whatsapp messages through ***[ChatAPI](https://chat-api.com/)***, a *Whatsapp API gateway*.

>*This project's purpose's to demonstrate some of my Java and ReactJs skills.*
>*I have done this by myself over time, with stuff I've learned. It is not copy-pasted code from a tutorial. It still lacks many features, I don't have much free time, so I try to do what I can, whenever I can. Hopefully, you won't be so harsh on me :)*

How it's looking so far:
